This is my python programming practice using real world dataset (HDB) from https://beta.data.gov.sg/ 
The work involves using np.genfromtxt to load in data file and create dataset, data cleaning & manipulating, construct visual charts for analysis
Only Numpy and Matplotlib package are used in this practice. Pandas and Seaborn etc are excluded. It aims to harness my coding skills with limited packages available.
